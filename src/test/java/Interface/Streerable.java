	 * A big Disadvantage of using abstract classes is not able to use multiple inheritance. In the sense, when a class
extends an abstract class, it can’t extend any other class. So we go for Interfaces.
Interface is:
Abstract classes which are completely unimplemented.
- Every method is abstract.
- A class implement any number of interfaces.
•All the methods in interface should be implemented in subclass else it becomes abstract class.
•Cannot be instantiated
Defining an Interface in Java
•Use interface keyword instead
all methods public abstract

	//Note: THe method should be public and abstract(There is no definition of method.Only declaration)
